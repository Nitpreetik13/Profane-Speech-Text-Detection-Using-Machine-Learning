# PROFANE TEXT SPEECH DETECTION USING MACHINE LEARNING

It is a Natural language Processing project 
wherein we will be dealing with profane text and then 
analyzing them. And then classifying the Profane tweets from clean tweets by machine learning models for classification, text mining, text analysis, data analysis and many more.
## OBJECTIVE

The main objective of this project is to detect profane speech
text. For example, if a sentence has something sacred 
and unacceptable towards someone's religion. Then, its task is to
declare or classify it as a profane text. Similarly it is done 
in the dataset as labels are given between 'C' AND 'P' where 
'P' is labelled for profane text and 'C' is written for 
clean text.



## DATASET INFORMATION 
Used only 2 coloumns wherein in one text is added and 
in second one the LABELS are introduced in front of each
classified text either in 'P' or 'C'.
The Training dataset and testing dataset is a csv file.
And Its compared via many models to compare the result
and accuracy.
